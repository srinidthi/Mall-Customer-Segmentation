Customer Segmentation Analysis with Python

This program is designed for customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a common practice in marketing and business analysis where customers are grouped into distinct categories based on their characteristics. Here's a general description of the program:

1. Data Preparation: The program starts by loading customer data, typically from a CSV file, into a structured format using the pandas library. It also scales numeric features (e.g., age, annual income, spending score) to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.

2. Determining the Number of Clusters (K): To find the optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation, the program employs the Elbow Method. It calculates the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for a range of potential cluster counts and identifies the "elbow" point in the WCSS plot. This elbow point suggests the ideal number of clusters to use in the K-means algorithm.

3. K-means Clustering: The program uses the K-means algorithm to cluster customers into groups based on their scaled features. K-means seeks to minimize the distance between data points and cluster centroids, assigning each customer to the nearest cluster.

4. Cluster Renaming: To make the results more interpretable, the program assigns custom names to the clusters. For instance, clusters with similar characteristics might be labeled as "High Income, Low Spending" or "Low Income, High Spending." These names provide business context to each cluster.

5. Visualization:The program generates a scatter plot to visualize the customer clusters. Each cluster is represented by a unique color and labeled with its custom name. Additionally, the program marks the centroids of each cluster in red on the plot.

By executing this program, businesses can gain insights into their customer base, understand distinct customer segments, and tailor marketing strategies or product offerings to better serve each segment's unique preferences and behaviors.
